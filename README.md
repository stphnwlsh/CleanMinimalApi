# Clean Minimal API 
This is a sample application to be an example of using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) alongside .net 6's [Minimal APIs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#introducing-minimal-apis).

## Features
- Logging using [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)
- Mediator Pattern using [Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)
- Validation using [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)
- Testing using [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly) and [NSubstitute](https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute)
- OpenApi using [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)

## Docker
There's a dockerfile included in the build folder and serves the purpose of restoring, building, testing, publishing and then creating a runtime image of the API.  Works on my machine.....

```
docker build -t cleanminimalapi:latest .
```

You can pull the public version of this image using

```
docker pull stphnwlsh/cleanminimalapi
```

## Prerequisites
This solution depends on the [pre-release SDK for .net 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0), you need to install that before it will work for you.

## Projects
This solution contains a few projects to follow the Clean Architecture patterns, it's by no means perfect.  But it's an example so cut me some slack.  Each project has a purpose and is separated from the others, for a far more well thought out solution please see [Jason Taylor's Clean Architecture Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture)
